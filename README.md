## üéØ Project Overview  
This extension was developed as part of our class project to learn more about **browser extensions and real-world applications** of JavaScript. Our goal was to create a **lightweight, user-friendly tool** that can handle both **currency and unit conversions** in one place.  

It supports:  
‚úÖ **Real-time currency exchange rates** (USD, EUR, GBP, CNY, JPY)  
‚úÖ **Length conversions** (meters, kilometers, miles, feet)  
‚úÖ **Weight conversions** (grams, kilograms, pounds, ounces)  
‚úÖ **A simple, easy-to-use interface**

## üöÄ How It Works  
1. Click the extension icon in your Chrome browser.  
2. Select what you want to convert: **Currency, Length, or Weight**.  
3. Enter a value and choose the units.  
4. Click **Convert** and get an instant result.  

The currency conversion feature fetches **live exchange rates**, while the length and weight conversions use **predefined formulas**.
